Description: This package provides an implementation of the 
    replica exchange Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting 
    ternary network models of gene regulatory networks.
    The input is a data frame containing five columns:
    an experiment index, a node index, an outcome (-1/0/1),
    the cost function for that outcome,
    and a boolean value indicating whether this experiment/node
    is an applied perturbation.  The model is the same as the
    ternarynet package; this is a parallel implementation that
    can run on multiple processors using Rmpi.
